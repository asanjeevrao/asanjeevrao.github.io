# Tetris ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
My implementation of the classic game, built using Vanilla JS - https://asanjeevrao.github.io/tetris/

Would love to hear any feedback about what I could've improved in the code/experience. 

There's a few known issues/improvements still pending on my list - 
* Rotating tetrominos near the left & right edges causes some blocks to bleed over the edge 
* Currently *Game Over* only checks if a new tetromino can't spawn because of a collision, there are other conditions such as when a piece gets locked out of bounds 
* Creating a *Hold Box* where users can temporarily store one tetromino
* Add the concept of Levels that increase each time you clear 10 lines, causing a speed increase & scoring system change
* Store *High Scores* in Local Storage
