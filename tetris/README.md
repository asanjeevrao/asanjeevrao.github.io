# Minesweeper ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
My implementation of the classic Windows game, built using Vanilla JS - http://asanjeevrao.github.io/

I used the implementation here as a reference for the CSS (https://nickarocho.github.io/minesweeper/, https://github.com/nickarocho/minesweeper). I hope you have fun playing this, I sure had a blast making it. ðŸ‘¾ 

Would love to hear any feedback about what I could've improved in the code/experience.
