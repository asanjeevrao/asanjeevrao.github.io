# Subreddit Aggregator ðŸ¤“ 
The homepage feed model of browsing reddit, while being endlessly addictive and a great source of quality content, has one problem - you often miss out on exciting/useful posts from subreddits you follow. There are several times when I discover  top quality posts from a subreddit through a specific Google search, which never showed up in my feed, despite being a DAU on Reddit. To solve for this, this subreddit aggregator lets you view a consolidated top posts list from a set of subreddits chosen by you, filtered by a time period that you select.

Would love to hear any feedback about what I could've improved in the code/experience. 

This is just a start and I would like to add many more features as I get better at coding-  
* Set the time filtering automatically based on when you've last visited the app
* Add a user account & login function so you can access the app on different devices
* Authorize & integrate with your reddit account so that the list of subreddits you follow can be extracted directly
* Build a smarter sorting logic for the posts that takes into account popularity of posts relative to the size of the subreddit
