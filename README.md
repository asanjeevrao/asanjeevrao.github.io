# Minesweeper ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
My implementation of the classic Windows game, built using Vanilla JS. I used https://nickarocho.github.io/minesweeper/ as a reference for the CSS. I hope you have fun playing this, I sure had a great throwback blast making it. ðŸ‘¾ 

Would love to hear any feedback about what I could've improved in the code/experience.
